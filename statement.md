## 📌 Problem Statement:>

In today’s academic environment, students are required to regularly calculate and track their GPA and CGPA. However, most students still depend on manual calculations, complex formulas, or confusing spreadsheets to determine their academic performance. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and often difficult to manage when dealing with multiple subjects and semesters.
There is a need for a simple, reliable, and easy-to-use system that allows students to enter their subject details and instantly calculate their GPA and CGPA in an accurate and organized way. The system should also maintain a record of previous calculations so that students can monitor their progress over time.
